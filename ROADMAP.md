## üöÄ Phase 8: Recording Flow Redesign (MUST-DO)
**Goal:** Professional recording experience with proper flow

**Current Issues:**

   - Two buttons: "Discard" or "Transcribe & Save"
5. When user presses "Transcribe & Save":
   - Show loading state during transcription
   - Process vocabulary and stats
   - Redirect to Session Detail page

**Technical:**
- [ ] Recording state machine (idle ‚Üí recording ‚Üí stopped ‚Üí previewing)
